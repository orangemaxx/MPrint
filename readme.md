# MPrint
My custom Print Server-ish thing written using python and flask

## For use
Requirements.txt should hopefully work :pray:. You'll need a mysql database setup. Use the .env file.
Better documentation will be around eventually idc

TODO:
- Dashboard
- Actual printer connection (Done on external repo)
- Fancy up login page
- un-chopped the database


## Special Thanks:
